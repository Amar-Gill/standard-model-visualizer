      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        All matter in the universe is made up of atoms and molecules. Atoms are composed
        of protons, neutrons and electrons. But is there anything smaller than that?
        Beyond the sub-atomic particles that compose atoms is the world of quantum
        mechanics. The theory that describes these quantum particles is known as the
        Standard Model of Particle Physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Standard Model has been developed over years. It is not yet complete, but it
        is our most accurate description of reality at the quantum scale. It successfully
        models most of the quantum mechanical equations that govern our physical reality.
        Below is a picture of the most common representation of the Standard Model.

      <p>
        The above table is a good start. But it fails to communicate the quantum
        interactions that occur between these particles. And some key quantum properties
        are simply missing.
      </p>
      <h2>Quarks</h2>
      <p>
        Matter is comprised of two main types of particles. Quarks and Leptons. The two
        types of quarks that comprise protons and neutrons are the up quark and the down
        quark. Up quarks have 2/3 of a unit of electric charge and the down quark has 1/3
        units.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also a quantum property known as spin, which refers to the direction the
        particle rotates with respect to it's direction of travel. "Left handed" quarks
        spin clockwise and "Right handed" quarks spin counter clockwise.
      </p>
      <p>TODO</p>
      <h2>Weak Force</h2>
      <p>
        The first quantum interaction we will explore is the Weak Interaction. It refers
        to the Weak Nuclear force acting between two quarks. One of the force carrier for
        the weak force is the W Boson. It has an electric charge of +1 or -1.
      </p>
      <p>
        A consequence of the weak interaction is that a left handed up and down quarks can
        transform into each when they exchange a W boson. No right handed W bosons have
        been observed in nature, so right handed quarks do not emit or absorb W bosons,
        and cannot transform into each other.
      </p>

        reiciendis quis odio? Laboriosam id non distinctio.
      </p>
      <h2>Strong Force and Color</h2>
      <p>
        Quarks have another quantum property known as color. The value can be red, blue or
        green. The color charge makes it sensitive to the strong nuclear force. It is the
        strong force that binds quarks of different color together into composite
        particles such as protons and neutrons, which end up with no net color charge, and
        are considered "colorless".
      </p>
      <p>
        The force carrier of the strong force is the gluon. Much like with W bosons,
        quarks of different color charge transform into one another by exchanging gluons.
        Gluons themselves have color charge, and therefore interact with each other as
        well. The interaction of gluons between quarks and amongst themselves can be
        modeled as a solid triangle between quarks. Both right handed and left handed
        quarks partake in the strong interaction.
      </p>
      <p>TODO</p>
      <h2>Leptons</h2>
      <p>
        The other set of particles that make up matter are Leptons. There are two types:
        electrons which have a charge of -1, and neutrinos, which are electrically
        neutral.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with quarks, left handed electrons and neutrinos interact via the weak force,
        and can transform into one another through the exchange of a W boson. However,
        right handed neutrinos have not been observed in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leptons do not have a color charge and therefore do not participate in the strong
        interaction. This is the primary feature distinguishing them form quarks.
      </p>
      <h2>Simplex Skeleton</h2>
      <p>
        Now we have what we need to form the skeleton of the double simplex model. The
        left handed particles on the left, and right handed particles on the right.
      </p>
      <h2>Three Generations</h2>
      <p>
        Now for a complication. For unknown reasons, matter particles exist in three
        generations, each getting progressively heavier. In addition to the up quark and
        down quark, there is the charm quark and strange quark, and heavier still, top and
        bottom quarks. They are otherwise identical in terms of other quantum properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Left handed quarks occasionally interact with other left handed quarks of
        different generations. So an up quark can emit a W boson and become a strange
        quark rather than a bottom quark. Leptons have not been observed to have this type
        of interaction between generations.
      </p>
      <h2>Electromagnetic Interaction</h2>
      <p>
        As stated before, all matter particles except for neutrinos have an electric
        charge. Particles with an electric charge can interact through the electromagentic
        force, of which the force carrier particle is the photon. Instead of changing into
        a different form of the particle, the electromagnetic interaction is a push or
        pull depending on the negativity of the charges involved.
      </p>
      <p>TODO</p>
      <h2>Weak Neutral Interaction</h2>
      <p>
        There is another force carrier of the weak force beside the W+ and W- bosons. That
        is Z0 boson, which has a neutral charge. Particles absorb or emmit Z0 bosons
        without changing identities. It only changes the energy and momentum of the
        particle. TODO - discuss diagram.
      </p>
      <p>
        The weak neutral interaction resembles the electromagnetic reaction because they
        used to be the same force. In the beginning of the universe, there was the
        electroweak force. As the early universe cooled, the force split into two in what
        is known as the electroweak symmetry breaking. This event also caused a new field
        to suddenly permeate spacetime, known as the Higgs Field. The carrier of which is
        the Higgs Boson.
      </p>
      <h2>Mass and the Higgs Boson</h2>
      <p>
        The Higgs Boson brings the standard model together, and ties together left handed
        and right handed particles. As particles interact with Higgs Bosons, they create
        excitations in the Higgs field. These excitations are what imbue particles with
        mass. In general, the more a particle interacts with the Higgs Field, the more
        mass it has. The neutrino is the one exception to this, it has mass, but it is not
        derived from interaction with the Higgs field.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Higgs interaction works generally like so. A left handed particle would be
        travelling through space, and bumps into a Higgs boson. The particle might
        ricochet and change in velocity and direction of travel. It might also become a
        right handed particle after the interaction. Afterwards it might bump into a Higgs
        boson again and become left handed once more, and so on. These interactions slow
        down the particle, the extent of which this occurs being the mass of the particle.
